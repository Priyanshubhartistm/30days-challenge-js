/* Combining Conditions*/

// Task 7 :- Write a program to check if a year is a leap year using multiple condtions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400 and log the result to the console)

let year = 2024;
let result = year % 4 ===0?
"leapyear":"notleapyear"
console.log(result);

// 2. Voting Eligibility Script: Write a script that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and log the result.

// 3. Day of the Week Script: Write a script that uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and log the day name.
